# Koharuri Driver's Aid
A Koharu Rikka warning you about speeding and all.  
## TODO
- **In case I forget: migrate / connect with BeamNG**  
Refer to this [manual](https://documentation.beamng.com/modding/ui/app_creation/)  
Leave some generic functions because we're not that much into BeamNG!!  

- **Make all the lines**  
With VOICEPEAK Rikka  

- **Randomise lines a bit**  
I'll figure out how, and I'll write TODOs in the code, not here  

- **Fix state migration (see agent_actions.js)**  
More details in the code itself, not here   

## How to debug
- **The safer way: using a local server**  
Navigate to root directory (which should be here),  
run: `python -m http.server [port]`,  
boot a browser and open up `http://localhost:port`,  
do everything.
